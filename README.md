# Master Your SAFe Certifications - Advanced Learning Platform 🚀

A comprehensive, modern web application for **mastering SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) certifications** with advanced learning features, progress tracking, and personalized study tools. This platform provides high-quality practice questions, adaptive learning systems, and detailed analytics to help you achieve certification success.

## 🆕 **Latest Updates (October 2025)**

### ⚠️ Browser Support Status (October 2025)
Full functionality (including complete exam flow E2E automation) is currently guaranteed on **Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc)**. 

The exam experience *loads and is usable* on **Firefox** and **Safari/WebKit**, but an automated test scenario exercising rapid answer navigation and submission intermittently times out in those engines. We have not observed user-facing crashes during normal paced usage; however, if you encounter an unexpected interruption in Firefox/Safari, please retry in a Chromium browser while we finalize the cross‑browser fix.

Tracking Issue: `firefox-webkit-exam-flow-timeout` (internal) – root cause under investigation (suspected interaction between autosave/timing loop and headless engine lifecycle).

If cross-browser parity is critical for your environment, use Chrome/Edge for formal practice sessions until this notice is removed. This section will be updated once the fix is confirmed.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jorense/safe-practice-exams.git
cd safe-practice-exams
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5177`

### 📱 **PWA Installation**

For the best mobile experience, install this app:

1. **Chrome/Edge**: Look for the install prompt or use "Install app" from the menu
2. **Safari**: Tap the share button and select "Add to Home Screen"  
3. **Firefox**: Enable "Install" from the address bar menu

**PWA Features Available**:
- ✅ **Offline Access**: Study without internet connection
- ✅ **Push Notifications**: Smart reminders and achievement alerts  
- ✅ **App Shortcuts**: Quick access to exams and AI companion
- ✅ **Native Feel**: Full-screen experience with safe area support

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory, ready for PWA deployment.

## 🚀 Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Current Configuration)
This repository is already configured for GitHub Pages deployment using the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

What happens on push to `main`:
1. Workflow installs dependencies (`npm ci`).
2. (Optional) Runs tests – you can skip by setting repository or environment secret `SKIP_TESTS=true` if a known flaky integration test blocks deployment.
3. Builds the site with `npm run build` (production base path `/safe-practice-exams/` comes from `vite.config.js`).
4. Uploads the `dist` output as a Pages artifact.
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages environment.

Live URL pattern: `https://<org-or-user>.github.io/safe-practice-exams/` – currently: `https://jorense.github.io/safe-practice-exams/`.

Manual trigger: Use the "Deploy PWA to GitHub Pages" workflow from the Actions tab (workflow_dispatch).

### Confirming / Enabling Pages
If the site does not appear after a successful run:
- Go to Settings → Pages → Ensure "GitHub Actions" is selected as the source.
- Check the workflow run summary for the final "Deploy to GitHub Pages" step.
- Verify `dist/` contains `index.html` and asset files (workflow lists them before upload).

### Cache Busting & Base Path
Vite build already sets `base: '/safe-practice-exams/'` when `NODE_ENV=production`. If the repository name changes, update that in `vite.config.js`.

### Common Deployment Adjustments
- Skip tests temporarily: add an Actions variable or secret `SKIP_TESTS` with value `true`.
- Pin Node version: adjust `node-version` in the workflow (currently 20).
- Add coverage gating: insert a step running `npm run test:coverage` and fail if coverage drops.

### Alternative Hosting Options
You can deploy the same build output (`dist/`) almost anywhere:

1. Netlify
	- Build command: `npm run build`
	- Publish directory: `dist`
	- Set Environment Variable: `NODE_ENV=production`
	- (Optional) Add `_redirects` file for SPA fallback: `/* /index.html 200`

2. Vercel
	- Framework preset: Vite
	- Build command: `npm run build`
	- Output directory: `dist`
	- Remove `base` override if deploying at root (set `base: '/'` or use environment override).

3. Docker (Static Artifact Serve)
	Create a `Dockerfile`:
	```Dockerfile
	FROM node:20-alpine AS build
	WORKDIR /app
	COPY package*.json ./
	RUN npm ci
	COPY . .
	ENV NODE_ENV=production
	RUN npm run build

	FROM nginx:1.27-alpine
	COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
	# Optional: Add custom nginx.conf for SPA fallback
	EXPOSE 80
	CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
	```
	Run locally:
	```bash
	docker build -t safe-practice-exams .
	docker run -p 8080:80 safe-practice-exams
	```

4. Azure Static Web Apps
	- App location: `/`
	- Output location: `dist`
	- Build command: `npm run build`

### SPA Fallback Considerations
For hosts that don’t automatically provide SPA routing (e.g. Netlify, Nginx): ensure all unmatched routes serve `index.html`.

### Deployment Verification Checklist
- ✅ Workflow run succeeded (green) on `main`.
- ✅ Pages environment shows latest commit.
- ✅ Console loads without 404s on static assets.
- ✅ Multi-select questions render and partial scoring works.
- ✅ Timing analytics modal opens and displays per-question data.

If any of the above fails, re-run the workflow manually or inspect the `dist/` contents locally with `npm run preview`.

### Fast Local Production Preview
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
Then open the printed local URL (typically `http://localhost:4173`).

### 🧪 End-to-End (E2E) Testing with Playwright (NEW!)

This project includes a multi-browser Playwright E2E suite covering:

- Core exam flow (start → answer → submit → results)
- Multi-select validation & partial credit heuristics
- Help system tour & panel interactions
- Autosave recovery after reload
- Timer expiry (best-effort; falls back to manual submit)

#### 1. Install Playwright Browsers (first time only)
```
npx playwright install --with-deps
```
(On CI / minimal environments you can use: `npx playwright install chromium` to limit scope.)

#### 2. Run the full test suite
```
npm run e2e
```
Runs all tests across: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, and a mobile Chrome profile (Pixel 7).

#### 3. Open the interactive UI mode (exploratory / debugging)
```
npm run e2e:ui
```

#### 4. View HTML report (after a run)
```
npm run e2e:report
```
Report output folder: `playwright-report/` (automatically git-ignored if you add it).

#### 5. Useful Environment Variables

- `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` – override dev server URL (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`).
- `CI=1` – enables retries (configured as 2) and prevents server reuse.

#### 6. CI Integration (Example GitHub Actions Snippet)
```yaml
steps:
	- uses: actions/checkout@v4
	- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
		with:
			node-version: 18
	- run: npm ci
	- run: npx playwright install --with-deps
	- run: npm run e2e
	- if: failure()
		uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
		with:
			name: playwright-report
			path: playwright-report
```

#### 7. Test Selectors

Deterministic `data-testid` attributes have been added to key UI elements (navigation, exam start buttons, quiz options, results metrics) to keep tests stable against copy changes.

#### 8. Flake Reduction Tips

- Prefer `getByTestId` over text queries for dynamic values.
- Use `await expect(locator).toBeVisible()` instead of manual timeouts.
- Keep heuristics (like searching for `/Results|Score|Correct/`) only as fallback.

#### 9. Extending Tests

- Add new specs under `tests/e2e/*.spec.js`.
- For new UI metrics, add `data-testid` attributes near semantic elements (e.g. results-score, results-correct).
- If you expose internal test hooks (like forcing timer expiry), gate them behind `if (import.meta.env.DEV)` checks for safety.

#### 10. Running a Single Test File
```
npx playwright test tests/e2e/exam-flow.spec.js --project=chromium
```

---

With this E2E layer + existing component tests, you now have defense-in-depth: unit, integration, and user journey coverage.
